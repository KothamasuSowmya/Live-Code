# ABOUT OUR PROJECT
THE ISSUE :- From information technology to science, engineering and also data analysis, coding play an important role in the economy. Big and successful projects are often developed by big teams. To make this happen there is no better platform for developers for better collaboration even though sending code in chat box option is available that doesn't make any sense because with that others can't edit.

OUR SOLUTION :- A plugin that allows host to send code,text or any message and publish to everyone so that others can also see and edit that text. And the changes made by other team mates can be seen by all making the process more easily:)

# HOW-IT-WORKS :- 
Click on Live-Code button
Send your code as message in the text area
Publish code for all your teammates.
